# üôè About Me 
I'm **Jordan Khong**, a 20 year old part time teaching assistant residing in Singapore. I teach about the C# Language, .NET Core Web development and WinForms.

 When I was young, I was really interested in computers and games. I played the Nintendo Wii a lot and tried making small flash games. To further pursure this interest, I took up a **Game Design and Development Diploma in Temasek Polytechnic.** I graduated in 2022.

You can drop me an email for collaborations or help if you would like:

# ü¶ã Interests
Though my main interest is programming, here are some of my other interests:

## üìú **Language & Cultures**

My primary language is **English** and my secondary is **Chinese**. I am currently trying to pick up **Japanese** through using Genki and Anki. I find that learning a new language unlocks a whole new perspective towards looking at life. It is also through this way that you get to appreciate many different cultures and their way of life. I love watching videos, particularly from [Asian Boss](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-_WWPT_124iN6jiym4fOw), which covers perspectives and news from various Asian countries.

Other than **Japanese**, I would also like to learn **Korean**, **Cantonese** and **Malay**.

<br>

## üòä **Content Creation**

I like to Stream games that I play on Twitch and make Youtube videos when I have the time. I am currently in the midst of setting up many of the things required, so I do not have much content yet. I love the idea of sharing the things you learnt or the experiences you have with others so they can also appreciate it as well. 

<br>

## üéÆ **Gaming**

You probably already saw this coming from a mile away. Although not strictly necessary, being a game developer means you play many games. I always joke that it is part of "studying" for Game Development. I don't really tie myself down to a specific genre, and like trying many different games just to understand why players like them. Here are some of my favourites:

- Rhythm: [Taiko no Tatsujin!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin), [Chunithum](https://chunithm.sega.com/) and [Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku:_Project_DIVA). 
- Platformers: [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy) and [Super Mario Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey)
- Shooters: [Apex Legends](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends)
- Strategy/RPG: [Persona 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5), [Fire Emblem: Three Houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem:_Three_Houses)
- Fighting: [Guilty Gear: Strive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/), [Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate](https://www.smashbros.com/en_US/), [Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles](https://asia.sega.com/kimetsu_hinokami/en/)
